Add-On Protocol - RS232 & USB
---

External devices can communicate with the GPS+GO device through the revised Third-Party Data protocol. An initial Handshake will need to be successfully negotiated in order for the GO device to accept third-party data. Data can only be sent in a predefined format and will be saved and sent to GPS+.

## Special Requirements for USB Integrations

The IOX-USB operates as a USB 2.0 full-speed host. The maximum data transfer rate is 12 Mbit/s. The IOX-USB can use two methods to enumerate a USB device:

1. The [Android Open Accessory protocol](https://source.android.com/devices/accessories/protocol.html). This [sample project](https://github.com/Geotab/android-external-device-example) can be used as a framework.

2. USB-CDC (Communications Device Class)

### Enabling IOX-USB Data Transfer

To enable third-party data communication on the IOX-USB, apply the following custom parameter to the GO device through GPS+.

```xml
<GoParameters><Parameter Description="Enable USB Data" Offset="164" Bytes="02"/></GoParameters>
```

The GO device will automatically upgrade to the ProPlus plan — with all associated charges — once third-party data transfer begins.

## Integration Process

The following process should be followed when integrating a third-party device with the GO device using our Third-Party Data Protocol:

### 1 - Request External Device ID

Contact the [GPS+ solution engineering team](mailto:ivalenzuela@gestsol.cl) to obtain an External Device ID for your third-party device. This will allow us to uniquely identify the device when it connects to a GO device. Thereafter, any connection established by that type of external device will be recorded as Status Data in GPS+ under the naming format "[External device name] device connected".

### 2 - Request Status Data IDs

Contact the [GPS+ solution engineering team](mailto:ivalenzuela@gestsol.cl) to obtain Status Data IDs for every separate piece of information you wish to send to the GO device.

For each piece of information, conversion parameters are also required. Conversions must be in the form as per the table below:

| Status Data ID | Description | Multiplier | Offset | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 (assigned by Geotab) | Odometer | 0.1 | 0 | km |
| 53 (assigned by Geotab) | Outside Temperature | 1 | −40 | degrees C |

The formula for the multiplier and offset values is as follows:

Final Value = (Initial Value × Multiplier) + Offset

### 3 — Implement the Third-Party Protocol

Implement the Third-Party Protocol in the external device as detailed below.

## Handshake

Ignition must be on for the handshake process.

1. After powering up, the GO device will enter an external device detection cycle. The external device will be powered for 72 seconds. In this interval, the GO device will listen for a Handshake Sync from the external device. The Handshake Sync is used to indicate that an external device is present. For implementations using the IOX-RS232, the Handshake Sync is also used to detect baud rate.
  - The external device must send the Handshake Sync message once per second.
  - If a Handshake Sync message is not detected from the external device after 72 seconds, the external device is powered down for 5 seconds, then powered up again to restart the detection cycle.
2. The GO device will reply to a Handshake Sync with with a Handshake Request.
3. The external device must reply with a Handshake Confirmation message within 2 seconds. If the external device would like an acknowledgment from the GO device that it received the Handshake Confirmation message, the corresponding flag in the Handshake Confirmation message may be set.
4. After sending the Handshake Confirmation message, the external device can begin to send third-party data as required. For every Third-Party Data Message sent, the GO device will reply with a Data Acknowledge message.
  - If the external device receives no response to a Third-Party Data message, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.
5. The GO device may send a Handshake Request message at any time after the initial handshake. The external device must respond with a Handshake Confirmation message. If the external device does not respond, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.

> See Appendix A for an example of raw message data. See Appendix B for a message flow diagram.

### Data

All values must be sent with the least significant byte first.

### Checksum

Each message will contain a 2-byte Fletcher's Checksum calculated across all the bytes of the message except the checksum itself. The checksum values are bytes, and as such overflow from 255 (0xFF) to 0 (0x00). The bytes used for the checksum calculation are all the bytes up to the checksum byte, including STX, LEN, TYPE, but not including ETX.

Checksum calculation pseudo code:

```js
byte ChkA = 0;
byte ChkB = 0;
// n is the number of bytes in the message
// up to, but not including, the checksum
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
ChkA = ChkA + MsgBuffer[i];
ChkB = ChkB + ChkA;
}
// ChkA precedes ChkB in the message
```

## Messages from the GO device

For the purpose of acknowledging the GO Device Data message when connected as an Enhanced HOS Device:

- The GO device will keep streaming the GO Device Data messages even if no ACK is received for up to 30 seconds.
- If no ACK is received in that time frame the GO Device will send an External Device Disconnected record to the server and will wait for a new Handshake Sync request from the External Device.
- If the ACK message is received within the 30 seconds the counter will be re-initialized.

### Msg Type 0x85: Request Device Data Message

This is a request-response message. It can be issued by the External Device whenever it wishes to receive the Device Data Info Message (Message Type 0x21).

### Msg Type 0x86: Binary Data Packet

Sent by the external device when sending binary data directly to the server. The contents of the message will be ignored by the GO device and simply sent on to the server for processing. The GO device will respond with the Binary Data Response message indicating whether the data was successfully sent via the modem.

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |

| Binary Data | x | 3 |
| Checksum | 2 | 3+x |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 5+x |
| _  Reply: Binary Data Response_ _       _ |   |   |

The payload of the binary data would need to adhere to a protocol understood by the server. The MIME data transfer protocol is under review and will be linked to from here when ready. The proposed implementation includes:

- Length of MIME type (1 byte)
- MIME type in ASCII
- Length of body (4 bytes)
- Body (raw bytes of MIME-type specified)

The MIME data message would need to be broken into 250 byte (or less) chunks and sent using the binary data packet message type 0x86. The server would stitch together the binary bytes and make then available via the GPS+ SDK once the full amount of bytes was received. See Appendix C.

### Msg Type 0x87: Third-Party Data as Priority Status Data

Priority Status Data will be treated the same as the 0x80 Status Data message, but will also be logged using an Iridium modem connection if available.

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x87 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 6 | 1 | 2 |
| Data ID (assigned by Geotab) | 2 | 3 |
| Data | 4 | 5 |
| Checksum | 2 | 9 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 11 |

### Appendix C: Using Binary Data Messages to Transfer MIME Data

MIME-type data can be transferred from an external device to the server via the GO device. It will be saved as a MIME-type blob on the server. The blob can be accessed through the software SDK. The SDK can also be used to send MIME-type data from the server to an external device connected to a GO device.

#### The MIME Type Protocol:

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MIME type length = x | 1 | 0 |
| MIME type in ASCII | x | 1 |
| Payload Length = y | 4 | 1 + x |
| Binary Payload | y | 5 + x |

The MIME protocol will be an inner protocol within the binary data packet messages. The MIME data will be broken into 250 byte chunks and sent within binary data packet messages. The first byte within the message will be a sequence counter; all remaining bytes will contain the MIME data.

#### Binary Data Packets Containing MIME Type Data

This is an example of binary data packets for image data transferred using the MIME type "image/jpeg". The image size is 83000 bytes.

**First packet:**

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 250 | 1 | 2 |
| **Sequence number = 0** | **1** | **3** |
| **MIME type length = 10** | **1** | **4** |
| **MIME type ("image/jpeg")** | **10** | **5** |
| **Payload Length = 83000** | **4** | **15** |
| **Binary Payload (the first 234 bytes)** | **234** | **19** |
| Checksum | 2 | 253 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 255 |

**Second packet:**

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 250 | 1 | 2 |
| **Sequence number = 1** | **1** | **3** |
| **Binary Payload (the next 249 bytes)** | **249** | **4** |
| Checksum | 2 | 253 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 255 |
